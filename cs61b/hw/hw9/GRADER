(a) Using DFS algorithm, we remark each node whether it is visited, so 
	if we encounter some node is visited, we know if the current node
	is connected with that node, loop occurs. So in that case, we just 
	remove the edge connecting them.

(b) Choose arbitrary node as root. If there are multiple edges connecting 
	current node, randomly select one and continue to use DFS algorithm,
	until all the nodes are visited.
