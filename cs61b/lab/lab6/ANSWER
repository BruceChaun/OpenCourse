part I

Error "deposit less than 0" if deposit a negative amount of money.
Error "Couldn't find account number" if deposit to or withdraw from a 
nonexistent account.
Report twice if deposit to or withdraw from a nonexistent account 
because in doDeposit() and doWIthdraw() operation, if account is non-
existent, two places print the error message -- ATM.deposit() or 
ATM.withdraw() and ATM.balanceInquiry().
