# Algorithms on Graphs (UCSD)

This is assignment of [Algorithms on Graphs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs).

The assignment includes the following related algorithms and applications:

1. Depth-first search in an undirected graph, reachability of one given node, and compute the connected components of an undirected graph;

2. Acyclicity of a directed graph, its topological sort, andstrongly connected components;

3. Breadth-first search in an undirected graph, and judgment on a bipartite graph;

4. Dijkstra spoint-to-point shortest path problem, Bellman-Ford method shortest paths from source to any point, and cyclicity in a directed graph;

5. Minimal Spanning Tree: Kruskal and Prim.
