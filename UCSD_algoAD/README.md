# Advanced Algorithms and Complexity (UCSD)

This is assignment of [Advanced Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-algorithms-and-complexity/home/welcome).

The assignment includes the following related algorithms and applications:

1. Network Flow in UD graph: Ford-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp algorithms, maxflow-mincut theory, and bipartite matching;

2. Linear Programming algorithms like Simplex (popular) and Ellipsoid (optional), implement Gaussian elimination method and Simplex algorithm. 

PS: There is another course -- "**Linear and Discrete Optimization**", by **École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne**, i.e., **Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne** -- which introduces LP in detail. My Simplex Algorithm is based on that and translated from my former _Matlab_ version. Unfortunately, this course is unavailable after the update of _coursera_.

3. P vs NP complexity and reductions of several NP-complete problems.

I just finished one assignment -- converting k-coloring to SAT.

4. Algorithms of special cases (2-SAT and independent set in trees), exact (3-SAT and TSP) and approximate algorithms (vertex cover and TSP).
