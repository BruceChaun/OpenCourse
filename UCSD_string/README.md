# Algorithms on Strings (UCSD)

This is assignment of [Algorithms on Strings](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings).

The assignment includes the following algorithms and application:

1. Build Trie from multi-patterns, pattern trie matching, naive method to build suffix tree, and shortest non-sharing substring problem;

2. Burrow Wheeler transform and its inverse, and pattern matching;

3. Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for text matching;

4. Build suffix array, pattern matching using suffix array, and build suffix tree from suffix array.
